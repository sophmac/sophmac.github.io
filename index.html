		<h3>About me</h3>

		<p>I am a PhD student in Mathematics at the University of British Columbia (UBC), under the supervision of <a href=https://www.math.ubc.ca/~marcus/>Brian Marcus</a> and <a href=https://sites.google.com/site/tommeyerovitch/home>Tom Meyerovitch</a>. My research is in an area called <a href=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Symbolic_dynamics>symbolic dynamics</a>, which involves concepts and techniques from dynamical systems and theoretical computer science.</p>

		<p>I finished my Master's (MSc) in Mathematics in August 2019, also in the UBC Mathematics Department, under the supervision of <a href=https://www.math.ubc.ca/~slade/>Gordon Slade</a>. My Master's essay was an idiosyncratic survey of a few results about entropy and computability in lattice systems. I hope to produce a human-readable version of this document at some point. Before coming to UBC, I finished my Hons Bsc in Mathematics and Statistics at McMaster University in April 2017. My undergraduate research advisers were <a href=https://ms.mcmaster.ca/~bprotas/>Bartek Protas</a>, <a href=https://ms.mcmaster.ca/craig/>Walter Craig</a> (now <a href=http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/news/Remembering-Walter-Craig-former-Fields-Institute-Director>sadly deceased</a>), and <a href=https://www.uwo.ca/math/faculty/khalkhali/index.html>Masoud Khalkhali</a> (through the Fields Institute's Undergraduate Summer Research Program).</p>

		<p>Apart from research, I was a teaching assistant in the Mathematics Department from September 2017 through December 2019, and co-facilitated the Department's first online TA training in August 2020. In the September-December 2020 term, I was a teaching assistant in the <a href=https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/>Master's of Data Science program</a>, assisting with DSCI 523 (Programming for Data Manipulation) in September 2020. I also facilitate workshops on teaching and presentation skills through UBC's <a href=https://ctlt.ubc.ca/?login>Centre for Teaching, Learning, and Technology</a> (CTLT), and have worked as a tutor for the <a href=https://nitep.educ.ubc.ca/?login>Indigenous Teacher Education Program</a> (NITEP).</p>
		
		<h3>Current work</h3>

		<p>Right now I am working on topics related to the classical Road Colouring Problem. This is a problem in graph theory that was unresolved for several decades until its solution in 2007-08 by Avraham Trahtman, even though the problem is very simple to state. Here is a statement of the problem that has become traditional in the community because it is vivid and fun, though it doesn't illustrate the significance of the problem within mathematics. </p>

		<p>Suppose you live in a neighbourhood where all the houses are connected by one-way roads, where a road starts at one house and goes to just one other. Each house has the same number of roads leaving it -- maybe there are 25 houses and each house has 4 roads leaving it, for example, so to get to your friend's house, you might have to go to several other houses along the way. Now, suppose you want to hold a party next week, and you want to get everyone there at the same time. It's a nice day outside, so you don't want to sit inside making a bunch of phone calls from your land-line to give people directions. (I, like, just barely remember when that's what you had to do, before most people had cell phones or Internet. It was a different time.) Instead, you want to go on a walk, and this gives you an idea for what to do.</p>

		<p>On your walk,  you'll put a big splotch of coloured paint on every road in the neighbourhood, using four different colours (say, red, green, blue, glittery purple), so that for each house, all the roads leaving it get different colours. Then you'll go to the community bulletin board that everyone looks at every day, and write down a time and a sequence of colours, like "6PM Saturday: red-green-purple-blue-red-red-blue". Here's the question: can you do it in such a way that everyone who starts following that sequence of colours, from their own house, will end up at your house? This is the Road Colouring Problem, and a colouring that works is called a synchronizing colouring.</p>

		<p>It turns out that the answer is yes, you can get a synchronizing colouring, as long as the roads in your neighbourhood satisfy one property: for any large enough number N, you can go on a walk starting and ending at your house (so that your famly doesn't get worried) where you make exactly N visits to different houses along the way (you might have to visit the same house more than once, that's OK). It turns out that if it's only possible to do this when, say, N is even, then you won't be able to colour the roads in a way that gets everyone to your house at the same time, although if you're willing to hold two parties at different times (or if you hold a party to watch the Tonys and your friend holds one at the same time at their house to watch the football game), then you can do it.</p>

		<p>I'm working on a couple of variations to this problem. What if you just colour the roads randomly -- how likely is it that you get a synchronizing colouring? How long might the synchronizing sequence of colours have to be? What if not all houses have the same number of roads leaving them -- what can you do then? Despite its whimsy, this problem actually has deep connections to several applications in physics and computer science, and I'm also interested in exploring those.</p>

		<p><b>Shameless advertisment for SCIE 300 students</b>: Hi! This paper is about Gibbs measures. A Gibbs measure is a kind of statistical distribution (specifically, for modeling stationary time series) that is very useful in contexts ranging from thermodynamics to scientific computing, because of how nicely it behaves when you want to calculate conditional probabilities. You might recognize the name "Gibbs" from the Gibbs free energy in chemistry, and it's no coincidence! There is a close connection between the way that equilibrium states of chemical systems minimize the Gibbs free energy and the way that Gibbs measures handle conditional probabilities. I think this is very, very neat!</p>

		<p>But there was an issue. There were a couple of different formulas for the Gibbs measure of a certain kind of system, and it wasn't totally clear that they gave the same answer. With guidance from my supervisors, I worked closely with my friend and colleague Luísa, and we were able to confirm that the two formulas always do give the same answer. This has made it possible for our research group, and others, to use either formula, depending on which one is more convenient at a given time, without worrying. The whole process taught us a lot about the kinds of geometric and probabilistic reasoning that go into this kind of question! We are now working separately on different research areas connected to this paper, and we talk about it often -- working on this problem together, as well as on the other preprint above, gave us a common reference point for talking about mathematical research in general.</p>
