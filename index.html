		<h3>About me</h3>

		<p>I am a PhD student in Mathematics at the University of British Columbia (UBC), under the supervision of <a href=https://www.math.ubc.ca/~marcus/>Brian Marcus</a> and <a href=https://sites.google.com/site/tommeyerovitch/home>Tom Meyerovitch</a>. My research is in an area called <a href=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Symbolic_dynamics>symbolic dynamics</a>, which involves concepts and techniques from dynamical systems and theoretical computer science.</p>

		<p>I finished my Master's (MSc) in Mathematics in August 2019, also in the UBC Mathematics Department, under the supervision of <a href=https://www.math.ubc.ca/~slade/>Gordon Slade</a>. My Master's essay was an idiosyncratic survey of a few results about entropy and computability in lattice systems. I hope to produce a human-readable version of this document at some point. Before coming to UBC, I finished my Hons Bsc in Mathematics and Statistics at McMaster University in April 2017. My undergraduate research advisers were <a href=https://ms.mcmaster.ca/~bprotas/>Bartek Protas</a>, <a href=https://ms.mcmaster.ca/craig/>Walter Craig</a> (now <a href=http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/news/Remembering-Walter-Craig-former-Fields-Institute-Director>sadly deceased</a>), and <a href=https://www.uwo.ca/math/faculty/khalkhali/index.html>Masoud Khalkhali</a> (through the Fields Institute's Undergraduate Summer Research Program).</p>

		<p>Apart from research, I was a teaching assistant in the Mathematics Department from September 2017 through December 2019, and co-facilitated the Department's first online TA training in August 2020. In the September-December 2020 term, I was a teaching assistant in the <a href=https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/>Master's of Data Science program</a>, assisting with DSCI 523 (Programming for Data Manipulation) in September 2020. I also facilitate workshops on teaching and presentation skills through UBC's <a href=https://ctlt.ubc.ca/?login>Centre for Teaching, Learning, and Technology</a> (CTLT), and have worked as a tutor for the <a href=https://nitep.educ.ubc.ca/?login>Indigenous Teacher Education Program</a> (NITEP).</p>

		<b>Shameless advertisment for SCIE 300 students</b>: Hi! This paper is about Gibbs measures. A Gibbs measure is a kind of statistical distribution (specifically, for modeling stationary time series) that is very useful in contexts ranging from thermodynamics to scientific computing, because of how nicely it behaves when you want to calculate conditional probabilities. You might recognize the name "Gibbs" from the Gibbs free energy in chemistry, and it's no coincidence! There is a close connection between the way that equilibrium states of chemical systems minimize the Gibbs free energy and the way that Gibbs measures handle conditional probabilities. I think this is very, very neat!

		But there was an issue. There were a couple of different formulas for the Gibbs measure of a certain kind of system, and it wasn't totally clear that they gave the same answer. With guidance from my supervisors, I worked closely with my friend and colleague Luísa, and we were able to confirm that the two formulas always do give the same answer. This has made it possible for our research group, and others, to use either formula, depending on which one is more convenient at a given time, without worrying. The whole process taught us a lot about the kinds of geometric and probabilistic reasoning that go into this kind of question! We are now working separately on different research areas connected to this paper, and we talk about it often -- working on this problem together, as well as on the other preprint above, gave us a common reference point for talking about mathematical research in general.
