		<h3>Academic bio</h3>

		<p>I am a PhD student in Mathematics at the University of British Columbia (UBC), under the supervision of <a href=https://www.math.ubc.ca/~marcus/>Brian Marcus</a> and <a href=https://sites.google.com/site/tommeyerovitch/home>Tom Meyerovitch</a>. My research is in <a href=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Symbolic_dynamics>symbolic dynamics</a>. I finished my Master's (MSc) in Mathematics in August 2019, also in the UBC Mathematics Department, under the supervision of <a href=https://www.math.ubc.ca/~slade/>Gordon Slade</a>. Before coming to UBC, I finished my Hons Bsc in Mathematics and Statistics at McMaster University in April 2017. My undergraduate research advisers were <a href=https://ms.mcmaster.ca/~bprotas/>Bartek Protas</a>, <a href=https://ms.mcmaster.ca/craig/>Walter Craig</a> (now <a href=http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/news/Remembering-Walter-Craig-former-Fields-Institute-Director>sadly deceased</a>), and <a href=https://www.uwo.ca/math/faculty/khalkhali/index.html>Masoud Khalkhali</a> (through the Fields Institute's Undergraduate Summer Research Program).</p> 

		<p>I have worked extensively as a teaching assistant in the Mathematics Department, as well as in the <a href=https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/>Master of Data Science</a> program. I also facilitate workshops on teaching and presentation skills through UBC's <a href=https://ctlt.ubc.ca/?login>Centre for Teaching, Learning, and Technology</a> (CTLT), and I have co-facilitated the Math Department's TA training since 2020. Currently, I am a mentor in the <a href=https://www.uroubc.com/rex/> Research Experience Program</a> at UBC.</p>
