		<h3>About me (with lots of links)</h3>

		<p>I am a PhD student in Mathematics at the University of British Columbia (UBC), under the supervision of <a href=https://www.math.ubc.ca/~marcus/>Brian Marcus</a>, <a href=https://www.math.ubc.ca/~lior/>Lior Silberman</a>, and <a href=https://www.math.ubc.ca/~angel/>Omer Angel</a>. My research is in an area called <a href=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Symbolic_dynamics>symbolic dynamics</a>, which involves concepts and techniques from dynamical systems and theoretical computer science.</p>

		<p>I finished my Master's (MSc) in Mathematics in August 2019, also in the UBC Mathematics Department, under the supervision of <a href=https://www.math.ubc.ca/~slade/>Gordon Slade</a>. My Master's essay was a survey of a few results about entropy and computability in lattice systems, like the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model>Ising model</a>. I hope to produce a human-readable version of this document at some point. Before that, I finished my Hons Bsc in Mathematics and Statistics at McMaster University in April 2017. My undergraduate research topics were on electrochemistry (supervised by <a href=https://ms.mcmaster.ca/~bprotas/>Bartek Protas</a>), Brownian motion (supervised by <a href=https://ms.mcmaster.ca/craig/>Walter Craig</a>, now <a href=http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/news/Remembering-Walter-Craig-former-Fields-Institute-Director>sadly deceased</a>), and random matrix theory (supervised by <a href=https://www.uwo.ca/math/faculty/khalkhali/index.html>Masoud Khalkhali</a> through the Fields Institute's Undergraduate Summer Research Program).</p>

		<p>Apart from research, I have been a teaching assistant in the Mathematics Department for a few years, although I'm currently a full-time research assistant. I also facilitate workshops on teaching and presentation skills through UBC's <a href=https://ctlt.ubc.ca/?login>Centre for Teaching, Learning, and Technology</a> (CTLT), and have worked as a tutor for the <a href=https://nitep.educ.ubc.ca/?login>Indigenous Teacher Education Program</a> (NITEP).</p>

		<h3>Preprints (one of these days this plural will be justified) and publications (again, one of these days)</h3>

		<p><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05532>"Conformal measures and the Dobrushin-Lanford-Ruelle equations"</a>, with Lu√≠sa Borsato. arXiv:2003.05532. Submitted to the Proceedings of the AMS.</p>

		<h3>Research talks</h3>

		<h4>Upcoming</h4>

		"Factors of Gibbs measures on subshifts", at the (online) <a href=https://sites.google.com/site/ottawamath2019/>Ottawa Mathematics Conference 2020</a>, June 1&#8211;5.

		<h4>Past</h4>

		<p><a href=https://www.mathtube.org/lecture/video/factors-gibbs-measures-subshifts>"Factors of Gibbs measures on subshifts"</a>, in the online <a href=https://www.math.ubc.ca/~lior/sem/WCDS.html>West Coast Dynamics Seminar</a>, May 7, 2020.
