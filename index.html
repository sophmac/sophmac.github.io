		<h3>Research</h3>

		<p>My work is in symbolic dynamics and related areas of mathematics and theoretical computer science. Symbolic dynamics is a branch of dynamical systems theory, and the best way to explain it (like pretty much everything else in math) is with an example. The very best short introduction to the area that I've found is <a href="https://plus.maths.org/content/smales-horseshoe">this two-part</a> <a href="https://plus.maths.org/content/smales-chaotic-horseshoe-continued">Plus Maths article</a> by Marianne Freiberger. While you're there, check out her excellent series of articles on COVID. You might also enjoy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZaEVoH9Z4k">this nice, short Quanta video</a> featuring Professor Bryna Kra of Northwestern University (and current president of the American Mathematical Society). One area of theoretical computer science closely connected to symbolic dynamics is the study of <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/finite-state-machines/">finite automata</a>. In particular, I study the phenomenon of synchronization in finite automata, in the context of the <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RoadColoringProblem.html">road problem</a> and its generalizations. I also work on problems related to information theory, which is introduced pretty well in <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/informationtheory#moderninfotheory">this series of short videos</a> at Khan Academy. </p>
